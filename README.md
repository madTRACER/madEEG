# madEEG

This project is a fork and reborn of an old project called "[OpenEEG](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/)".

The main feature of this project is that it uses currently available SMD components. Moreover, in the future I'm planning to try to make it cheaper using DSP instead of amplifier filters where it is possible.

I wanted to make it myself as a pet project, but unfortunately I don't have enough time and money. However, I really want this project to be developed... You are welcome to contribute!

## Requirements and tools

Schematic and PCB - [KiCAD](https://kicad-pcb.org/) 

Firmware - [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) or any other IDE/code editor (As for me, I've recently migrated from CubeIDE to [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/))

 Software - haven't thought about it yet, open to suggestions.
